# Welcome to TrustEdge Labs

**Building the foundational layer for verifiable data in a zero-trust world.**

TrustEdge Labs is an organization dedicated to engineering the future of data integrity. In an era where digital information is abundant but trust is scarce, our mission is to create the tools and platforms necessary to produce **cryptographically verifiable truth** at the point of creation.

We are building the engine for the next generation of secure applications, from IoT and AI to digital evidence and supply chain management. Our work enables developers and organizations to handle sensitive data with absolute confidence in its privacy, authenticity, and provenance.

Our flagship project, [`trustedge-core`](https://github.com/TrustEdge-Labs/trustedge), is a high-performance, open-source Rust library that serves as the heart of our ecosystem. It is a data-agnostic engine designed to:

*   **Secure Any Payload:** Seamlessly encrypt and secure any data stream—from audio and video to sensor telemetry and log files—at the moment of capture.
*   **Create Unbreakable Provenance:** Generate signed, tamper-evident manifests inspired by the C2PA standard, creating an unbreakable chain of custody for every piece of data.
*   **Enable Zero-Knowledge Operations:** Allow organizations to validate and manage data without ever needing to decrypt it, dramatically reducing liability and security risks.
*   **Deploy Anywhere:** Run natively on servers, on embedded IoT devices, and even in the browser via WebAssembly (WASM).

## Our Vision: The Managed Trust Platform

The `trustedge-core` library is the open and auditable foundation of a much larger vision: a **Trust-as-a-Service** platform.

We believe the future of data security isn't just about providing libraries; it's about providing a complete, managed solution. Our commercial strategy is to build a robust, scalable cloud platform that uses `trustedge-core` as its engine. This platform will offer our partners a turnkey solution for:

*   **Verifiable Data Ingestion & Validation**
*   **Secure, Compliant Archiving & Retention**
*   **Immutable Audit Trails**

This "open-core" model allows us to offer the transparency of open source with the reliability and convenience of a managed service, empowering hardware OEMs and service providers to bring verifiable data to their customers with ease.
